- skip the first 40 secs withouth anything, only a hat. As a DJ-intro I'd
  suggest more of the bass and kick (maybe filtered). Makes mixing in easy
  (beatmatch)
- first 3 minutes are a bit boring, not much happening. I like the bass at 2.50
  coming in
- No drums or anything rhytmical in the break --> what should the audience move
  to if theres only the high delayed sounds? Keep some of the drums going
  filtered.
- Build op to drop needs work. Lacks anticipation. Drum rolls, FX, reverb-drown,
  wash-out, anything.
- Lack of an idea of the track, where does it move to? Some hook or leadsound
  misses.
- Overall low-end sounds a bit ' dry' and empty. The moments where the tom hits
  near the kick feel the best.

Maybe a sidechained sustained bass/reese to fill op the lows?

- Overall transition FX to make the track interesting
- Break quite ling compared to the track.
- Best part is the 40 secs after the drop.
- Overall some nice elements (high sounds, vocal in drop, saw-bass) but needs
  some extra work. For a 1 day track, absolutely awesome

- [ ] Redo sound design lead after drop
- [ ] bass isn't syncopated enough, especially in the intro
- [ ] sidechain pads atmos too strong
- [ ] turn off sidechain in breaks
- [ ] transitions too loud maybe? rattle
- [ ] loud one shot in break middle
- [ ] long break would go straight into bass, not this "chill drop"

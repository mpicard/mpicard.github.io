## Notes

## First Listen

- [x] toms are bit intense in intro
- [x] intro atmos to quiet
- [x] 1m toms change completely weird
- [x] toms are too loud
- [x] 2m missing ear candy
- [ ] missing [[Shimmer]]
- [x] no cooldown before break, transition not smooth
- [x] vox could be teased earlier in first focus
- [x] 4m42 the arp is very quiet in the background, when will it be lead element?
- [x] not atmospheric enough, probably because toms are too loud

## Final Listen

- [ ] fix...

## Reflection

What went well? What didn't go so well?

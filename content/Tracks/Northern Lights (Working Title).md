- [ ] Find better title
- [ ] suggestion would be to get rid of the guitar and synth from the break and
      focus on the pad and arp. To my ears that arp sounds very interesting and
      could totally make the track.
- [ ] pads too bright
- [ ] major/minor change? surprise?
- [ ] is the rolling bassline the right vibe?
- [ ] way to long to introduce bassline
  - [ ] first note kinda off?
  - [ ] surprising bassline compared to first 3minutes

## Notes

- Emotional pads moved from Track #2
	- they sadly got lost because Ableton asked me if I wanted to keep temp recordings and I clicked no without realising
	- hard lesson learned, not easy
- Need to balance the massive pad with other elements
- Focus on frequency carving and sidechain compression

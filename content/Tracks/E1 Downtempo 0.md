has potential

## First listen

- [x] 0m20 intro has too many chords, no drone
- [x] 0m45 very nice but too soon?
- [x] 1m44 too much cross mod
- [x] 2m missing a bass layer
- [x] 2m50 call response too quick
- [x] 3m25 too bright
- [x] 3m45 add tension string
- [x] 4m do the synths start too early? or too quickly too early?
- [x] 4m20 new percussion? foreshadowed percussion?
- [x] 5m03 bad resonance/dynamics
- [x] 5m30 hihats too static
- [x] 5m48 too bright
- [x] 6m00 unceremonious ending

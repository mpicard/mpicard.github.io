## Arrangement Check

- [x] 2m10 bassline gets boring needs some automation and fx
- [x] 2m40 oh no that intro for that lead sounds so bad
- [x] Break too loud?
- [x] lead to loud? resonanes?
- [x] lead needs more variation marco morph
- [x] 4m20 very nice fx
- [x] not enough sides in highs
- [x] 5m29 more echo feedback
- [x] could be a little longer second half

## First Listen

- [x] after last drop needs something to change more
- [x] 2m cooldown section missing something atmospheric?
- [x] cooldown 2 section maybe missing atmosphere or ?
- [x] last drop needs transition
- [x] 1m change the 1shots with fx a little more, more delay
- [x] last one shot is weird, try pick another
- [x] automate bass echo send / feedback mod
- [x] too often syncopated snare

- [x] kick too boomy, muddy, sloppy, long
- [x] clap a little too loud
- [x] 3m pads too quiet in break
- [x] maybe pad needs more mids 1~2k? 5m00
- [x] arp maybe needs gain automation? 3m30-4m30

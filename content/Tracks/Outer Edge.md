## First Listen

- Kick isn't right
- too slow BPM
- not enough panning on lead
- 1m too bright in intro probably
- 1m24 change the hithat?
- what is the focal point at 1m50? confused
- first break sucks, do you even need it?
- 2m25 perc change sample it's boring
- 3m random bell could probably come earlier
- 3m30 arrangement obviously
- not really any tension in the second break
- B sounds exactly like A
- 4m40 this shaker comes back now? why not earlier?
- 3rd break really unnecessary delete it
- 6m synth around the head is sick but too late

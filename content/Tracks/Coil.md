## First Listen

- 0m11 too bright
- 0m30 clap cheesy change sounds
- 0m50 dub boring do marco morph variations
- 1m30 those response chords come too early maybe
- they are also missing macro morph
- 2m really bright and dry
- 2m46 lead goes away transition abrupt
- 3m watery fx are cool
- 3m50 break doesn't introduce anything new, do we need two breaks?
- 4m15 drop doesn't hit and the clap neither
- 4m50 B is same as A

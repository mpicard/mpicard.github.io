# Track #2 - 444

[[Weekly Challenge]] #2

- [x] 2m40 is the destination - work backwards from here for storytelling
- [x] Tension building synth and chords don't work together
- [x] 0m50 and 1m50 still need percussion elements
- [x] shimmer!
- [x] 1m30 missing something
- [x] 3m very long time to wait for pads
- [x] drums needs more ATTITUDE
- [x] shaker too loud?
- [x] second drop same as first drop
- [x] try saturation after reverb?
- [x] 8:45mins it's probably too long

## Reflection

Interesting it's supposed to be the second weeks track but because I got
distracted by an unplanned track, that is a newer exciting remix project I got
distracted and never finished this one on time to be considered finished in the
second week.

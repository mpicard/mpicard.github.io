- intro is too sparse
  - add more percussion loops
  - bigger / better clap
  - bigger / powerful / better offbeat hat
- bass is too boring
  - make bass more interesting
- lead melody/hook comes too late, 4min too long
  - bring lead earlier
  - more melody
- weird mix
  - problems in sub/bass
  - check all the synths to make sure it's low cut

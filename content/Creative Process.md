_The problem_:

Trying to do everything all a once feels more "creative" but it creates
distraction, wastes time and leads to poorer outcomes. There is a tangible order
that must be followed in order to finish music tracks.

The CAM process for finishing music tracks has 3 stages to go from start to
finish. Each stage has two phases and a checkpoint at the end of the step. The
phases can be broken down into even smaller parts, this is where personalisation
of the process happens.

CAM works because it's about the mindset that you adopt during each phase.
Constantly and going back and forth between mindsets is what creates a lot of
problems.

Note: Mastering is out of scope. The finished track is a full track that is
mixed and ready to be mastered.

## Creative Stage

### Experimental Phase

- Mindset:
  - Fearless curiosity
  - It's research, not production
  - Find unique sounds/ideas
  - Don't force a song
  - Follow rabbit holes
  - Flow
- Problems / Pitfalls
  - Tool paralysis
  - Perfectionism
  - jumping to arrangement too soon
  - endless sound searching
- Solutions
  - time-boxing (25-90 mins)
  - limit your toolkit
  - bounce audio; capture the magic immediately
  - Quick randomisation to generate surprises
- Goal
  - find creative flow and ride it as long as possible
  - avoid distractions
  - produce a pool of unique, emotionally interesting raw materials
    - hooks, grooves, textures, etc
- Outcome
  - multiple raw ideas you can reuse
- Checkpoint
  - you have >3 distinct or variant ideas saved/named/organised
  - Bounce short audio clips of your best experimental moments (30-60 seconds)

### Functional Phase

- Mindset:
  - Pragmatic creativity
  - tighten, not kill, the vibe
  - build options inside a loop
  - fix genre, tempo, style, etc
- Problems
  - overprocessing
  - clutter
  - not building arrangement options
  - losing momentum by fixating on tiny details
- Solution
  - stay in the loop
  - build modular layers (drums, bass, synths, etc)
  - create energy macros (low-end, brightness, density)
  - 3 energy states for drums
- Goal:
  - a loop that represents the core song idea
- Outcome
  - loop is ready to arrange
  - have several "energy levels"
  - loop validation
  - ready for next stage or redo phase 2?
- Checkpoint
  - Bounce the final loop (32 bars) with all the energy levels

### Checkpoint: Loop Validation

- Mindset:
  - director, imagine the story arc before building it
- Problems / Pitfalls
  - no destination
  - weak second half
  - no hooks to build toward
- Solutions
  - run the "take-out" test (mute kick, mute hook, mute ambience) to see where
    you can go
  - sketch a first half (A) vs second half (B)
- Goal:
  - confirm there's a clear path from A->B
- Outcome:
  - pass or todo list things to fix before arranging
- Checkpoint: Ready if
  - "What will change in second half?"
  - "Which element will carry the change?"

## Arrangement Stage

### Sketch (first full pass)

- Mindset: author / storyboard
  - speed over polish
  - get the macro story in place
  - Main arc foundation
- Problems / Pitfalls
  - editing forever
  - perfecting sections before the whole exists
  - ear fatigue from over-listening
- Solutions
  - do a single uninterrupted pass (60-180min)
  - start -> finish
  - use loop variants and placeholers
  - avoid detailed mix moves
  - use markers
  - label everything
- Goal
  - full arrangement skeleton that plays start to finish with believable story
- Outcome
  - an imperfect but complete arrangement with all main elements placed
- Checkpoint
  - full track plays from start to end without dead sections
  - sections are roughly balanced and length approximates target release format

### Progressions & [[Transitions]]

- Mindset: playwright
  - shape motion inside and between sections
- Problems / Pitfalls
  - flat energy within sections
  - abrupt or indecisive transitions
  - filler that kills momentum
  - distracted by mixing / professional sounding / perfection
- Solutions
  - plot an energy curve for each section
  - create 1-3 transition tools (eg. riser, sweep, dropout)
  - foreshadowing motifs (introduce tiny hook early)
  - tighten automation lanes and macro moves
  - less is more, change on thing at a time
- Goal
  - clear internal progression per section
  - smooth, intentional transitions between sections
- Outcome
  - arrangement that feels pruposeful (rises, breaths, payoffs)
- Checkpoint
  - every section has at least one distinct progression
  - every transition has a defined purpose ([[Contrast]] / [[Reveal]] /
    [[Reset]])

### Checkpoint: Arrangement Final Check

- Mindset
  - external listener / first time listener / QA
  - Treat it as somebody else's track
- Problems / Pitfalls
  - hearing fatigue
  - defensive edits mid-listen
- Solutions
  - export premix, take 24h break, do 1 uninterrupted listen
  - take time-stamped notes: Good / Bad / Maybe
  - Prioritise the notes
- Goal
  - discover what still breaks the story or confuses the listener
- Outcome
  - short prioritised fix list for arrangement and pre-mix tweaks

## Mixdown Stage

### Step 1: Setup

- Mindset: technician / historian
  - protect the reference premix and set the right environment
- Problems / pitfalls
  - mixing in the production project
  - losing reference
  - headroom problems
  - messy routing
  - going backwards to creative/arrangement stages
- Solution
  - open a fresh DAW project
  - import the exported premix
  - and grouped stem premixes
- Goal
  - a clean, dedicated mixing session with quick references ready
  - beat the premix, it's gotta sound better
- Outcome
  - you can A/B against the premix and won't accidentally "go backwards"
- Checkpoint
  - premix and stems loaded

### Step 2: Foundations

- Mindset: sculptor's foundation
  - balance before cosmetics
- Problems / Pitfalls
  - over-EQ'ing to fix level issues
  - mixing by meters not ears
  - chasing tiny EQ moves early
- Solutions
  - perform a fader-only mix first
  - use "too loud / too quiet" technique to find levels, then
  - 3-tier EQ: HP/LP, tonal, surgical, group first then track level
- Goal
  - solid relative balance and
  - low-end clarity
- Outcome
  - balanced rought mix where elements sit clear together
- Checkpoint
  - kick + bass locked in (no masking)
  - main peaks safely below -6 to -10 dB

### Step 3: Dynamics & Width

- Mindset: stage manager
  - control energy and spatial placement
- Problems / Pitfall
  - stereo mud
  - low-end in sides
  - over compression killing dynamics
  - phase issues
- Solutions
  - check mono compatibility
  - remove low freq from sides
  - tame peaks
  - visual + listening tools
- Goal
  - controlled dynamics and coherent stereo image that translates
- Outcome
  - punchy low end
  - clear center
  - intentional width in the sides
- Checkpoint
  - mono-sum check OK
  - low end stable in mono
  - no uncontrolled peaks

### Step 4: Creative Colouring

- Mindset: artist
  - add identity and coherence without drowning clarify
- Problems / Pitfalls
  - over-saturation
  - washed out sound with FX, diluting the original idea
- Solutions
  - create tasteful group buses for glue (subtle bus compression, saturation)
  - use returns for reverb/delay with controlled send levels
  - add creative colour sends (analog, tape, distortion) w/ automation
  - Subtle 10-30% of effect is usually enough
  - group processing
  - creative sends: parallel compression/distortion/etc
  - distortion/colour
  - mix automation: more dynamic mixdown
  - creative effects: experimental, a/b test always
- Goal
  - cohesive sonic character and polish that support the tracks identity
  - streamline the process
- Outcome
  - a mix with personality that still reads clearly across elements
- Checkpoint
  - A/B with premix
  - coloration is improving tone/interest without masking
  - glued but not smothered

### Step 5: Finalise and QA

- Mindset: producer
  - final checks before mastering
- Problems / Pitfalls
  - tweak paralysis
  - mix not translating
- Solutions
  - export final mix with headroom for mastering
  - export required stems
  - test on multiple systems
  - one final 24h break+listen
  - only implement high priority changes
- Goal
  - finished mix that translates and is ready for mastering
- Checkpoint
  - exports at correct sample rate/bit depth
  - headroom preserved
  - music translates acceptably

## Practical Metrics and Quick Rules

- Time-boxing
  - experimental sessions and arrangement sketches
- Options rule
  - 3 options per group (drums, synths, ambience?) = fewer stalls
- Loop validation test
  - can you mute the hook and still feel a path forward? yes = validated
- A/B baseline mixing
  - beat the premix - mix must improve in clarity/impact
- Evidence
  - finish 1 track end-to-end every 4-8 weeks (or whatever is realistic) to
    build confidence
  - evidence => confidence

[[CAM Process]]

### **Creative Phase**

**Mindset: exploration → functional building**

- **Experimental:**
  - [ ] Limit tools (keep it small).
  - [ ] Timebox sessions (25–90 min).
  - [ ] Record/resample every idea.
  - [ ] Save ≥3 raw ideas/variants.
- **Functional (build loop):**
  - [ ] Make 8–16 bar loop with core (kick, bass, hook, percussion, ambience).
  - [ ] Create ≥3 variation options per group.
  - [ ] Build energy macros (low-end, brightness, density).
- **Loop validation:**
  - [ ] Can I answer “what changes in 2nd half?”
  - [ ] Can I answer “which element carries that change?”

### **Arrangement Phase**

**Mindset: storytelling → refinement**

- **Sketch:**
  - [ ] Arrange full track start→end.
  - [ ] Use placeholders, don’t polish.
  - [ ] Mark sections (intro, build, drop, break, drop2, outro).
- **Progressions & Transitions:**
  - [ ] Each section has 1+ progression (automation, texture, density).
  - [ ] Each transition serves purpose ([[contrast]] / [[reveal]] / [[reset]]).
  - [ ] Keep “one change at a time” rule.
- **First listen test:**
  - [ ] Export premix, wait 24h.
  - [ ] Single uninterrupted listen.
  - [ ] Timestamp notes (Good / Bad / Maybe).
  - [ ] Fix only high-priority issues.

### **Mixdown Phase**

**Mindset: sculpting → polish**

- **Setup:**
  - [ ] Open fresh DAW project.
  - [ ] Import premix + stems (grouped).
  - [ ] Set headroom (-6 to -12 dBFS).
- **Foundations (levels + EQ):**
  - [ ] Do fader-only balance first.
  - [ ] Kick + bass locked.
  - [ ] EQ: utility (HP/LP), tonal, surgical.
- **Dynamics & Width:**
  - [ ] Control peaks (compression/clipper).
  - [ ] Mono check passes.
  - [ ] Remove low end from sides.
- **Colouring:**
  - [ ] Group processing (glue, sat).
  - [ ] Reverb/delay on sends.
  - [ ] Tasteful coloration (saturation, tape, FX).
  - [ ] creative effects
  - [ ] automating mixdown
- **Finalize:**
  - [ ] Export with headroom.
  - [ ] Check on 3+ systems (headphones, speakers, phone).
  - [ ] Do final 24h listen + note pass.
  - [ ] Bounce final mix + stems.

### **Completion Checkpoint**

- Full arrangement plays start to end.
- Each transition has purpose.
- Mix beats the premix in clarity/impact.
- Exports clean, headroom preserved.
- Track translates across systems.

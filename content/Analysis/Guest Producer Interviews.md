## Obbie

- Play with Resonators on drum loops with Resonator MIDI CTRL device
- Modulate the decay! Decay of drums, synths can really add a layer of depth and
  groove
- Add 3rd, 5ths to leads, etc with Chord device automation
  - same instrument or experiment with different instruments
  - in arrangement to add intensity
  - or different instrument softer in the back
  - or 3rd+oct up
  - gentle panning
- Grandulator -> Audio -> Beat transient warp -> 10~20 percent -> Shimmer Reverb
- rhythmic synth element
  - driving
  - eg gated pad
- Basslines
  - don't just play root
  - play notes around the root before moving chords
  - be happy with bass in every track, groovy bass is a must
- Chord Progressions
  - emotional part of song usually the low mids, pads etc
  - adding a low mid note(s) can bring more emotion to progression
  - After progression, add a bass note to the first chord to refresh the
    progression make it feel longer/different/emotional

## Molac

- Less processing. Better sample selection
- Pads eat up a lot of headroom which could be used for more interesting melodic
  element
  - (subjective; depends a lot on vibe)
  - Dont make such huge pads
  - push pad into background
  - pads more like fillers than constantly droning
- Don't use too many loops, it removes a lot of creative space for unique sounds
- compressors are obviously overrated in 2024, use
  - transient shaper
  - clipper
- classic utility automate width for drops
- returns
  - sidechaining FX ~50% let sounds breath
- always keep evolving (current sound has evolved from the sound you hear on
  released tracks)
- Keep it simple

## Adrian Front

- Short punchy kick
- Focus on groovy bass so need to EQ kick to make room for bass
- Percussions with a melody
- Percussion has a hook

## mredrollo

- Worth watching twice
- Create cool moments with crazy contrast/tension
- What makes this track special/unique?
- Find unique moments
  - we're struggling with this
  - no hook
- 1 month to finish song
- 2 weeks in the middle is very hard work
- 1 last week of polishing
- the struggle is real, trust the process, push through
- apologies to your girlfriends!!
- be careful negative feelings creep in real fast
- Tim Green said "you've done it before, you can do it again"
- Be Zen
- Synths all coming from analog synths recorded in one or two takes, mistakes
  and all
- Touch your synths!
- Melodic Techno is dead! Long live Organic!
- Dulus in an experimental phase
- Put hooks in your drums!
- simple processing, saturation, EQ, delay, reverb
- Levelling up happened after analysing references more closely
  - analyse wave form
  - similar sonic pallet
  - eg. kick waveform, volume, wave, shape, pitch, etc
  - Kick almost always G1 (48.999Hz) in his references
  - go deep with the analysis
  - constantly resampling to compare, put a resampling track in your template!
  - Kick punch was a mystery for a while
  - Analysed kicked are soft clipped
  - push kick harder into glue compressor soft clipper
  - kicks punchy now
- the YouTube hole
  - consuming instead of making
  - prioritise finishing tracks
- takes years of practice to get to point where you know what kind of
  style/direction you want to go
- less youtube, more music making / experimentation!
- Sound design tips?
  - adding vocals in any form can transform your tracks
- melodic often 1 take
- Use the Ableton Capture button!
- Keep it simple: 3 return tracks
  - Delay
  - Reverb
  - Override (send tops for extra spice)
- Mastering as you go
- Mixing way more important than mastering
- you need all this fancy shit
- self reliance and self confidence
- their is no secret tip(s) that will make your music better
- only the grind/experimentation will really level you up

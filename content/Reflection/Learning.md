split into two distinct phases:

## Consumption Phase

information is consumed

## Digestion Phase

information is digested/recalled/practiced to form long lasting neural networks.

## Summary

~90% of what we consume we forget unless it is accompanied directly with a
digestion phase!

**Learning must be balanced, don't waste time consuming more when you have not
yet digested the information!\***

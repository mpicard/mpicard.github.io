## Five Questions

### 1. Where in your life or your work are you currently pursuing comfort, when what's called for is a little discomfort?

### 2. Are you holding yourself to, and judging yourself by, standards of productivity or performance that are impossible to meet?

### 3. In what ways have you yet to accept the fact that you are who you are, not the person you think you ought to be?

### 4. In which areas of life are you still holding back until you feel you know what you're doing?

### 5. How would you spend your days differently if you didn't care so much about seeing your actions reach fruition?

# Hierarchy

1. Song (Abstract)
2. Arrangement (Rhythm / Chords / etc.)
3. Performance (Programming / MIDI / Velocity / Automation)
4. Recording (Audio / Flattened)
5. Mix & Master (Mixdown, FX, mastering)
6. Production (Final product)

> **DAWs blur the line between these stages**. Understand where you are in your
> work.

#### Examples:

- Don't waste time on FX when you're arrangement is not done.
- Don't get stuck mixing when you haven't composed the song yet.
- We don't expect the movie director to also write the script, act and do the
  camera at the same time

## What separates us from productive artists:

- They also struggle with inner demons / self sabotage
- But they have **process and habits** to overcome this war
- The more in autopilot you are, the better.
- Too much choice you slows down.

## Steal/borrow Shit

- Steal chord progressions
- Steal synth patches
- Steal rhythms

## Producer

- Big picture holistic
- Producer is the one who could say "take that fucking instrument out of the
  mix"
- What does the audience want/expect/need
- BE THE AUDIENCE

## Artist / DJ

Context the DJ or audience can bring to the production:

- Audience
- Culture
- Dance Moves
- Territory
- Social Trends
- Gender
- Location
- Indoors/Outdoors
- Mixing tracks
- Genre trends

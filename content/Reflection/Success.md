- Am I doing this for me or others?
- Do you find joy in the process or the result?
- How many failures?
- Would I still be proud if it got zero plays/likes?
  - release your work only when you are proud of it
  - intention, if you are proud then you have already succeeded
- If I had infinite success tomorrow, would I change what/how I create?
  - would you still make the same thing?

## Why is Techno Hypnotic..?

One could argue that without hypnosis or hypnotic elements, techno becomes
something else. With too much chord progression, or even lyrics to 'wake you up'
it becomes something similar to progressive (progressive house, progressive
trance, progressive breaks) and electronica.

Hypnosis has been with us since Detroit Techno, Hi NRG Disco, New Beat and Acid
House merged in England during the British Summer of Love and the sound of the
"hypnotic groove" as kicked off by Chicago House and Phuture became deeply
interwoven in the fabric of techno's DNA since then. It is even cited as a major
influence on LFO’s track “Intro.”

With the advent of minimal techno. Hypnosis became a predominant tactic to help
elements become swept under the rug so to speak. Although the technique has been
used predominantly in ambient as characterized by Brian Eno’s definition (which
was seemingly derived from Eno’s fascination with Satie’s “Furniture Music”):
“Ambient music must be as ignorable as it is listenable.”

Though there are more current trends focused on making hypnosis the main goal,
such as Psyk and Non Series really diving into the potential of the use of
hypnosis as a leading element and not only as a vehicle for other conceptual
ideas in techno. In that sense “Hypnotic Techno” as a genre is like Dub Techno
in that it has used a conceptually forward idea that is present in the creation
of techno like Dub mixing techniques and its tropes. Techno is inherently
hypnotic but it does not rely on only that as the central theme in order to
justify being called only Hypnotic Techno. Hopefully that makes sense.

Without hypnotic elements it becomes difficult to pin down the concept of Techno
musically. So to speak, if you want to make music sound more techno, adding at
least one hypnotic element will help tremendously. Hypnosis in techno forces an
altered state. When making techno, try to direct your efforts into the hypnosis
overall and produce techno from this perspective. If your techno doesn’t sound
techno enough, this is lacking from your tracks. Try adding a few of these as an
element.

## Audio Hypnosis Techniques:

*Timing:* Near 1/32 delay starts of notes, disassociated sounds (not on time)

*mimicking altered states response:* subtle, commanding the listener by leading
by example, echoes. disembodied reverb. Far away sounds

*Ignorable:* drones, 8th notes constant, repetition, Arpeggios..voice mantras,
chant

_Visualisation technique_: Place calming environments such as a soundscape,
field recordings etc. this will allow the listener to step into that world and
not be a part of the conscious world. Present Calming nature-like sounds/
birdsongs in synths.. mimic running water/white noise/womblike sounds.

_Hyper imagination_: Samples to think about

_Strobing_: Rapid panning on 8th notes, staccato repeats..

_Cycling_: changing loops or cycles in hoops overhead -combines panning, drone,
and strobing techniques

_Suspension_: Half step ups at the end of the bar or half step up suspensions no
relief means insistent, but also ignorable. These sound like questions and lead
the mind to drift because it implies you should think of a question to ask
yourself, or your surroundings. Hypnotic music always questions upward because
it never goes back to the tonal center. it's atonal.

*Audio mirroring:* the dancer will want to mimic what is going on in the music.
create catchy danceable phrases, things and frequencies made for the shoulders,
panning for the head to follow. Possible call and response ideas.

*Physical posture technique:* creating a relaxing state of calm. Warm bass
drums, heavy tonic elements. Something to induce theta states in the brain..

*Sensory overload technique:* confusion, barrage of information

*Rapid induction technique shock:* unexpected.. give them what is expected and
switch it up.

*Pace and Lead technique:* the subject will enter a trance state because the
person wants to believe.. or you agree to their position and then redirect them
to the part you want. Not insistent.

*Stealth technique:* boring someone into a daydream. minimal sounds so much the
same that the material becomes forgettable.. add this to the shock technique and
you have a very interesting 1-2 punch.

*Ear fixation technique:* provide a steady frequency.. not like a drone..
something that really stands out in the dead center of the mix so that it can be
fixated on. Then the rest of the world drops away. A good example of this would
be disco strings carries, or a dissonant harmonic carrier tone (in a layered osc
synth) as the centerline of the track.

It is my firm belief that techno has been successful by and large as it
represents an alternative to music that has a narrative element. Like Rock, or
Vocal House, or anything that embraces this in western harmonic and tonal music.
The lack of conscious narrative and the emphasis on speaking to the subconscious
is a relief for those in altered states of consciousness with too much to think
about, or it becomes a background to those thoughts and is not interrupted by
another’s person’s external narrative when trying to calm one’s own mind.

Alternatively, it can similarly bring about altered states of consciousness
through the negation of one’s own conscious mind, similar to tribal dance and
entering trance induced states.

- **Separate Processing for Wet and Dry Signals** (0:32): The core idea is to put reverbs and delays on their own channels (return tracks or instrument racks) and apply effects to them separately from the dry signal. This allows for greater control and definition in the mix.
    
- **Delay Processing**
    
    - **Inbuilt Filters** (3:52): Utilizing the filters that come with delays to shape the sound.
    - **Modulation** (4:14): Adding modulation to the delay's filter for an evolving sound.
    - **100% Wet Setting** (4:20): Setting the delay to 100% wet and grouping it into a rack with a dry chain for separate processing.
    - **Erosion Effect** (4:41): Using Ableton's Erosion to add a unique texture and create distinction from the dry signal. Modulating the erosion effect (5:01) can create an almost melodic feel.
    - **EQ/Auto Filter for High-End Clearance** (5:51): Rolling down the high frequencies with an Auto Filter or EQ to make space for other elements in the mix, like vinyl crackle and hats.
    - **Phaser** (6:19): Adding a phaser effect to the delay.
    - **Sidechain Compression** (6:34): Sidechaining the delay to the kick drum to create a pumping effect.
    - **Ping Pong Mode and Utility** (7:00): Using ping pong mode for stereo spread and then adjusting the amount with a Utility plugin to control the width.
    - **Delay Send Automation** (8:17): Automating the gain of a utility placed before the delay to control when the delay is active, allowing for "dub mixing."
- **Dry Signal Processing**
    
    - **Overdrive Distortion** (7:38): Subtly applying overdrive distortion to the dry signal for warmth and grit.
- **Reverb Processing**
    
    - **EQ8 for Frequency Separation** (10:06): Using EQ8 to high-pass the reverb, allowing it to occupy more of the high-end frequency spectrum, creating separation from the delay which might be more low-end (10:21).
    - **Utility for Level Boosting** (10:44): Boosting the reverb's level with a Utility after EQing to make it stand out.
    - **Pre-Delay and Sidechain Compression** (10:56): Setting the pre-delay to zero and using a compressor sidechained to the dry signal to duck the reverb, creating a similar effect to a pre-delay.
    - **Stereo Field Manipulation with Auto Pan** (11:56): Making the reverb more mono and then applying an Auto Pan for subtle movement through the stereo field.
    - **Reverb High-Pass Automation** (12:44): Automating the high-pass filter on the reverb to create dynamic changes in its sound.
- **Master Compression for Spatial Effects** (13:22): Applying a compressor at the end of the chain to compress all the reverbs and delays together, ducking them when the dry signal hits and then fading them in, adding depth and clarity.
    
- **Macro Mapping for Performance and Automation** (14:40): Grouping the delay and reverb racks and mapping key parameters like delay send and reverb high-pass to macros for easy automation and "dub mixing" during performance.

Slightly different than a double trilogy break, this is LotusTunes' take on an
extended break that seems much better for [[Musical Identity - Conduit]]
project.

# Cooldown - 16 bars

- Filter down drums
- Reduce intensity of low end
- Slowly blend in atmospheres

# Break - 16 bars

- All in Atmosphere!
- Pads
- Textures
- Chord progressions
- FX

# Build - 16 bars

- 1 or more elements open up
- Riser and /or snare roll
- more automation

# Warmup - 16 bars

- Introduce drums with filter
- Tease something, usually bassline
- Delay, Feedback and FXs
- Reverb automation on drums, wash out

# Release

- Introduce new surprise element

In music, a motif is a pattern that repeats and is recognisable when it returns
after being removed.

## Example - Arcaze - To it to it feat. Cherish

- Motif is is being reenforced by the voice, the violin, synths, etc.
- Motif super clear, later you can sing it in your head
- The motif is the little musical idea that they are trying to ram into your
  skull

## Example - Julio Bashmore - Au Seve

- A rhythmic motif, aka counterpoint
- The lead and the bass diverge in terms of pitch, but not rhythm!

## Example - Aphex Twin - Ageispolis

- Motifs can also be super long
- This long/complex motif works because the rest of the elements are super
  simple
- But it's really committed to it so it works

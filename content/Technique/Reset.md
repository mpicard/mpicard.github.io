Reset is about _breath_ - space that makes the next hit stronger.

Purpose: give the ear a break, wipe the palette, or return the track to a
neutral state before continuing.

Mechanics: you strip back, often dramatically, so the track can rebuild energy.
It's the sonic equivalent of a deep breath.

Examples:

- full stop (dead silence or single crash hit) before next section
- dropping down to just a pad or atmos layer before rebuilding
- cutting to mono or dry signal for 1-2 bars, then reopening

Pitfall: too long a reset drains momentum; too short feels like a glitch

Checkpoint: ask "after this reset, does the re-entry feel more powerful because
of the space I created?"

Every transition should serve the _narrative of energy_ - up, down, sideways. If
it doesn't do something, it risks being filler.

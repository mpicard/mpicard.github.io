Very subtle modulation

## Tick Tock

- take a sound and make 2 versions, tick and tock
  - pitch up down
  - decay short long
  - fx
  - etc

## Pulsating Filter

- LFO a HPF
- good for HHs
- use a long rate (ie over several bars) so it doesn't become repetitive

## Parallel Moving Layer

- parallel chain w/ a lot of FXs with modulation

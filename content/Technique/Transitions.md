## Common arrangement arcs in electronic music

### Intro -> Build

- establish a goove, draw listener in, DJ mix in
- [[Contrast]]: add/subtract layers every 8-16 bars
- [[Reveal]]: subtly foreshadow main motif
- [[Reset]]: rare here, but a short stop like 1-bar silence

### Build -> Drop

- main payoff
- [[Contrast]]: strip low end
- [[Reveal]]: lead hook or full drum pattern finally lands, tension->payoff
- [[Reset]]: a 1/2 bar silence right before the drop. suck air out trick.

### Drop -> Break

- relieve tension, give contrast so next drop hits
- [[Contrast]]: density -> sparseness
- [[Reveal]]: introduce a new melodic element or pad that wasn't in the drop,
  fresh palette
- [[Reset]]: common here, kill the groove, fade to near silence, rebuild

### Break -> Drop 2

- second emotional peak - either higher or different flavour than first drop
- [[Contrast]]: break's smoothness makes the return of drums hit harder
- [[Reveal]]: either bring back the original hook in full or reveal a new
  variation (counter-melody, harmonics, etc)
- [[Reset]]: micro-silence right before the impact keep the impact sharp.

### Drop 2 -> Outro

- closure, DJ mix out
- [[Contrast]]: energy tapers - remove elements
- [[Reveal]]: somteimes you reveal a stripped version of a motif
- [[Reset]]: fade to ambience or hard stop

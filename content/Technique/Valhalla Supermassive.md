- Density controls reverberation
- Warp control movement

**Gemini**: Simple delays with feedback.

**Hydra**: Two delay chains.

**Centaurus**: Multiple repeating echoes

**Sagittarius**: Reverb and repeating echoes

**Great Annihilator**: Long reverb and repeating echoes

**Andromeda**: Lots of smaller repeating echoes and long reverb. Great for
smearing sounds into a long drone.

**Large Magellanic Cloud**: Single delays with lots of feedback and reverb.

**Triangulum**: Never ending simple echoes, slightly off.

**Lyra**: Really tight echoes. Great for drones using warp and feedback.

**Capricorn**: Really tight delays almost like spring reverb.

**Cirrus Major**: Short tight repeating delays. Really nice for building
tension.

**Cirrus Minor**: Really short tight repeating delays.

**Cassiopeia**: Lots of feeding back echoes – great for dub / dub techno sounds.

**Orion**: Out of time echoes, that filter out quickly.

**Aquarius**: Really tight delays and reverb, like a combination or spring and
then plate reverb. Can make some really nice pads with this, just feeding in a
chord stab and playing with the warp and density.

**Pisces**: Really tight delay and reverb, like the Aquarius mode. Great for
sound design especially pads.

**Scorpio**: Dense tight delays.

**Libra**: Repeating echoes that filter out over time. Great for dub/dub tech
no.

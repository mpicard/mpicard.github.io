Reveal is about _payoff_ - showing something hidden, fulfilling a promise.

Purpose: introduce something new as the payoff - show the listener what was
hidden or **foreshadowed**.

Mechanics: you tease or layer a sound quietly, then bring it full force. The
transition becomes the moment of arrival.

Examples

- a synth arp faintly in the background of the build, then unmuted fully in the
  drop
- vocal chops hinted with heavy reverb, then revealed clean and upfront
- percussion notif ghosted earlier, then revealed in full texture

Pitfall: if the reveal doesn't feel earned, it's flat. Needs tension-building
before.

Checkpoint: ask "does the transition deliver on something I hinted at earlier?"

Every transition should serve the _narrative of energy_ - up, down, sideways. If
it doesn't do something, it risks being filler.

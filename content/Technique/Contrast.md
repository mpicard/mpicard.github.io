Contrast is about _energy perception_ - drop feels big because the build was
thin

Purpose: make the listener notice the shift by emphasising _difference_

Mechanics: you exaggerate the change in energy, density, texture, or register so
that the next section feels fresh.

Examples:

- pulling out the kick and bass for 1-2 bars before they slam back in
- dropping a high passed, filtered drum loop before the low end returns
- switching instrumentation (dark -> bright, dry -> wet, sprase -> dense)

Pitfall: if overdone, it feels gimmicky or jarring

Check: does the next section feel bigger/clearer _because of what I constrasted
against?_

Every transition should serve the _narrative of energy_ - up, down, sideways. If
it doesn't do something, it risks being filler.

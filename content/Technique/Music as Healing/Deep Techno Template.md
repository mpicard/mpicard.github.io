### **1. Entry / Calibration (0:00–1:30) — Cognitive Anchor**

  

**Goal:** Orient the brain. Slow entrainment begins.

- **Tempo:** ~124 BPM
    
- **Energy:** 30%
    
- **Harmony:** tonic drone or root + 5th (no third yet).
    
- **Progression:** Em9: sustained pad, subtle evolving harmonics.
    
- **Design:** LP-filtered pads + noise textures, long reverb tail.
    
- **Kick:** Enters filtered and compressed, low in mix.
    

  

Neuro cue: predictability creates comfort; ear locks to pulse.

### **2. Emergence (1:30–3:00) — Dopaminergic Engagement**

  

**Goal:** Introduce rhythm and harmonic identity without emotional resolution.

- **Harmony:** move to subtle color: Em9: Gmaj7. or Em9: Dadd9.
    
- **Perc:** hats, shaker, minimal groove with micro-swing (60–70%).
    
- **Modulation:** introduce 0.3–0.5 semitone pitch drifts on pad.
    
- **FX:** Delay panning automation — creates spatial novelty.
    

  

Neuro cue: pattern + small surprises keeps reward system tuned.

### **3. Hypnotic Flow (3:00–4:30) — Motor Entrainment**

  

**Goal:** Sustain trance-like focus; loop-based minimalism with microscopic shifts.

- **Harmony:** maintain Em base, occasionally invert to Gmaj9 or Dadd9.
    
- **Groove:** full kick/hat/bass lock; sidechain tight.
    
- **Automation:** 32–64 bar filter sweeps or LFO speed changes.
    
- **Sound design:** subtle low-frequency modulation (40–80 Hz) to sync with body rhythm.
    

  

Neuro cue: motor cortex sync; listener physically internalizes groove.

---

### **4. Emotional Aperture (4:30–5:45) — Limbic Expansion**

  

**Goal:** Induce chills or release; widen space, lift harmonically.

- **Harmony:** shift to relative major / lifted voicing: Cmaj7: Dadd9.
    
- **Arrangement:** pads swell, high-end opens.
    
- **FX:** Reverb predelay increase + widening; filter envelope bloom.
    
- **Perc:** transient reduction → perceived “float.”
    

  

Neuro cue: dopamine–prolactin crossover — emotional release.

---

### **5. Dissolution (5:45–7:30) — Parasympathetic Reset**

  

**Goal:** Bring listener down gently; integrate the high.

- **Harmony:** descend slowly to base tonality, Em9: Cmaj7. fade to tonic drone.
    
- **Rhythm:** strip groove; leave low-frequency pulse faint.
    
- **Texture:** reintroduce analog hiss or environmental ambience.
    
- **Automation:** LPF closing over 2 minutes; delay feedback decays naturally.
    

  

Neuro cue: heart rate decreases, alpha rhythm dominance returns.

---

### **Production DNA**

- **Kick:** 80–110 Hz body, 3–5 dB sidechain on pad and bass bus.
    
- **Bass:** minimal; sine or sub-triangle sidechained to leave negative space.
    
- **Pads:** stereo width automation (70–130%) to simulate breathing.
    
- **Noise:** continuous low-level broadband noise glues mix and calms the brain’s “prediction error” system (Levitin cites this).
    
- **Dynamics:** never exceed 5 LUFS RMS; loudness crushes depth.

### **Mindset**

  

Think of it as a _physiological arc_, not just an arrangement.

Your role is to **design a regulated nervous system**: start neutral → entrain → activate → release → restore.

  

If you want, I can give you a **chord progression chain** (M2TM format) that fits this exact template — designed to walk through each of those phases seamlessly. Want me to lay that out?

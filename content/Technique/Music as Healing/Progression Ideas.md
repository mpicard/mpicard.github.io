Here’s a set built specifically for that deep techno neuro-flow template — one progression per phase, all compact and in valid **M2TM** format:

---

**1. Entry / Calibration (drone tension)**

Em9: Em(add2): Em9.

  

**2. Emergence (identity + subtle color)**

Em9: Gmaj7. Dadd9.

  

**3. Hypnotic Flow (loop hypnosis)**

Em9. Bm11. Gmaj9.

  

**4. Emotional Aperture (lift / release)**

Cmaj7. Dadd9; Em9.

  

**5. Dissolution (cool down / return)**

Em9: Cmaj7. Am11.

---

Each one can loop 4–8 bars comfortably and morph through filter, delay, and modulation layers without harmonic fatigue.

Stack them sequentially across your track to trace the emotional arc without abrupt tonal shifts.

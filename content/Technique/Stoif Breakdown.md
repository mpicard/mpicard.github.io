- Layering
  - Lots of layering, don't be shy some sounds have 3+ layers
- Transition FX
  - many layers of risers, reverses, crashes, tails, etc
  - classic reversed reverb tails
  - Not all FX hit exactly on the transition downbeat
    - OTT works really well for increasing reverse reverb tail gain
    - Dissonant reversed chord reverb tails
    - One shots before and after transitions
  - Fill up spectrum with tension building elements with more layers
  - Backstreet boys samples
  - Whitenoise downfilter after drop
  - classic sub sweeps into break
  - blur the line between groove and entering breakdown
- Tension
  - Several layered lead sounds
  - negative space, remove instruments also increases tension
  - add layer in second half of break to increase tension
  - add new instrument(s) last bar of drop!
  - Drum fills
    - add to second half of break
    - slapbacks are a must here
    - SURPRISE ITS DULUS!
    - snare rolls etc
- Long Breaks
  - conceptually the same but with more tension
  - new instruments
  - classic bring back kick "tease" with high pass near end

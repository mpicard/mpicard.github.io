Think of it as an XY plot where X is melodic intervals and Y is harmonic
intervals. Then we chain these vectors to create counterpoint.

Classical composers thought counterpoint was the most important aspect of
composition.

# "Rules"

## Melodic Intervals (horizontal)

1. melodic intervals larger than a step must be consonant
   - Skips allowed: 3rds and minor 3rds
   - Leaps allowed: 5ths (4ths also okay)
   - Leaps **not allowed**: tritones, major 7ths, minor 7ths
2. Have a good "shape"
   1. ie. goes up, ie. goes down, subjective
   2. not too many repeated notes
   3. mostly steps and skip
   4. not too many leaps (this rule get broken a lot in acid)
3. Avoid chromatic half step motions! (i.e. going out of key)

## Harmonic Intervals (vertical)

homo-rhythmic or poly-rhythmic

### Motions

1. **Contrary motion:** one voice moves up, one moves down, best sounding
   motion, but you can't always stay in key with contrary motion, which is why
   the follow other motions exist;
   1. (up by step down by leap is okay)
2. **Parallel motion:** voices move in same direction by same interval
   1. can only do with non-perfect intervals ie 3rds and 6ths
3. **Oblique motion**: one voice does not move or sustained, another voice moves
   skip, step or leap, it's **allowed but not great. It's naughty avoid!**
4. **Similar motion**: same direction but voices jump different intervals (eg.
   one step, one leap).
   1. Allowed as long as you don't land on a perfect 5th (special rules for
      landing on perfect intervals)

**Avoid parallel 5ths and parallel octaves**

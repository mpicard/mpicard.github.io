[[Composition]] technique

- remember: first break mixed with previous track
- second beat second: previous track (probably) mixed out
  - needs to standout on it's own
  - needs to be like "oh this song i know this song"
- break (suggestion: trilogy break)
  - 4 bar fall
  - 4 bar rise
  - hang (don't drop the kick yet for a bar)

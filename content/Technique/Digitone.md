- Really fast LFO on Level A makes a really cool gritty lead sound
- change key/chords in new pattern to a relative/similar one
- use a wider range of pitches for the arp, eg -2 to +2 oct
- Use track D for a riser sound that uses all the envelops with long attack and
  LFOs with fade-ins

## Bass

- set key of track and arp on
- play keys to find interesting basslines

## Metal

- ALGO 7
- C A B ratios all ~6
- ratio offsets find sweet spots

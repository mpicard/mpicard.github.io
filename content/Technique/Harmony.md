### Open Voicing

- start with triad (e.g., Fm, or D#m)
- push the 5th (highest note) up one octave
- keep lowest and highest note
- make progression (inside the key) with the middle note

### Open/Power Chord

- 1+5th
- aka. triad minus the middle note

### More dramatic

- Lower lowest note an octave down

### Jamming Chord 7 over 1

- very dance/house-y thing to do

### Dorian

- feel: Minor with "hope"
- how: Minor with #6

### Tritone

- aka augmented fourth, diminished fifth, aka Devil's interval
- 6 semitones! 666!

### Melancholic

- minor arp
- add 6th, it's unstable and melancholic
- done
- more?
  - add 2nd, it's also unstable, adds more feels

### Dark

- Phrygian mode
  - minor but flatten 2nd
  - super dark when you play the 1st, 2nd, 5th and 6th (all 1st apart)

## Background Synth Polymeter

- 3 note ARP
- use sin or triangle wave, soft, not too many overtones, in background
- use 6th, avoid 2nd, 4th
  - e.g., F3, C4, C4# (or C5#)
  - 2 bars
- 3rd bar push all but root +1st
  - e.g., F3, C4#, C5#
  - 2 bars

### Aggressive Lead

- Super saw
- with sustain
- arp 16th
- jam on arp, always return to root
- play with note length / gate length and filter cutoff
- avoid 7th! It's too progressive for melodic techno

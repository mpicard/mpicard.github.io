Reverse engineer a reference track to learn

- Take reference tracks
- add markers for sections
- Insert empty midi clips for every instrument/sound on timeline
- delete reference track

Good to do this every once in a while or whenever inspiration isn't happening to learn about genre or artist that we like to reverse engineer it.

## Why is so good

- learn arrangement, track architecture
- learn critical listening, why does this track work etc

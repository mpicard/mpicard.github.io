title: Some Lodash functions in ES6
---

There's quite a few posts out there with Lodash functions but there's a few that I couldn't find so here's a list of those ones. Check back often because I will very likely keep updating this page with more and more as I go along.

## times

```javascript

// lodash
_.times(n, iteratee);

// ES6
Array.from({ length: n }, iteratee);

```

## groupBy

```javascript

// lodash
_.groupBy(array, fn);

// ES6

const groupBy = (array, fn) => array.reduce((acc, val) => {
  (acc[fn(val)]) = acc[fn(val)] || []).push(val);
  return acc;
}, {});


```

## head and tail

```javascript

// lodash
const tail = _.tail(array);

// ES6
const { head, ...tail } = array;

```
